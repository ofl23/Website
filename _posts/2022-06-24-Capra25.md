This week I attended the 25th Capra Meeting on Radiation Reaction in General Relativity at University College Dublin which was my first in person conference in over two years! It emphasised how useful the small discussions can be and was very useful to talk to other people from my field in a such a way that had been impossible with the pandemic.

I was also fortunate enough to be able to do my first in person talk to present my research including hot off the press results. My talk was so well received that I was awarded the runner up position for the Best Student Talk Prize! The slides for my talk can be found [here](https://oliverlong.info/talks/capra25).
