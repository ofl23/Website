Five years, petabytes of data and many hours of computing time has gone into imaging the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy. Congratulations to the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration on this amazing feat!

One of the most exciting parts about this image to me is the likeness to the previous image of M87*. The two objects differ in size and mass by orders of magnitudes and yet produce such a strugglingly similar image. This is exactly what is predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity hence we have further confirmation of the theory which underpins my area of research.
