Here are a selection of gifs that I have produced for talks I have given about my research. 

Feel free to use them for your own purposes but please give credit where it is due.

Geodesic scatter orbits
-----

![](/images/ScatterOrbits.gif)
A selection of scatter geodesics paramterised by the velocity at infinity $v_\infty$ and the impact parameter $b$. The Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) is shown for reference.

Sample scatter orbit
-----

![](/images/ScatterPaper.gif)
<br>A sample scatter geodesics parameterised by $(v_\infty,b)=(0.2,21M)$. The Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) is shown for reference.

Scatter orbit definitions
-----

![](/images/ImpactParamScattAngleDef.gif)
A graphical representation of the definitions of the impact parameter $b$ and the scatter angle $\delta\varphi$

Weak-field bound orbit
-----

![](/images/PNPMOrbit.gif)
A small portion of the bound orbit of two equal mass compact objects at large separation.


Radiation gauge string solutions

Graphical representations of the string solutions of the metric perturbation $h$ in radiation gauges. The red line represents the string-like singularity and background colours represent different radiation gauges. <em>Left</em>: Full-string solution. <em>Centre</em>: Half-string solutions. <em>Right</em>: No-string solution.
