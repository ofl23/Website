My name is Oliver Long and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute)](https://www.aei.mpg.de/) in Potsdam, Germany.

My research focuses on the numerical modelling of unbound binary black hole encounters. These high-energy systems allow us to probe the ultra-strong gravitational potential and increase our understanding of General Relativity. To explore these systems, I employ a range of methods, including [Numerical Relativity]({{ '/projects/NR/' | relative_url }}) for the comparable mass case and [self-force]({{ '/projects/SelfForce/' | relative_url }}) techniques from black hole perturbation theory for extreme-mass ratio scenarios.

I am a member of the [SXS collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/), the [LISA Consortium](https://www.lisamission.org/), and a former member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/) (LSC). Additionally, I am a contributor to the [Spectral Einstein Code](https://www.black-holes.org/code/SpEC.html) (SpEC), and the [KerrGeodesics](https://bhptoolkit.org/KerrGeodesics/) package of the [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](https://bhptoolkit.org/).

I completed my PhD in Mathematical Sciences at the University of Southampton in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Leor Barack. My thesis, titled “<i>[Self-force for hyperbolic black hole encounters](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/457451/)</i>,” was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC). Prior to that, I earned my MPhys in Physics from The University of Manchester in 2018.
