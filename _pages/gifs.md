Here are a selection of gifs that I have produced for talks I have given about my research. 

Feel free to use them for your own purposes but please give credit where it is due.

Geodesic strong-field scatter orbits
-----

![](/images/ScatterOrbits.gif)

A selection of scatter geodesics paramterised by the velocity at infinity $v_\infty$ and the impact parameter $b$. The Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) is shown for reference.

Geodesic weak-field scatter orbits
-----

![](/images/ScatterOrbitsb.gif)

A selection of scatter geodesics paramterised by the velocity at infinity $v_\infty$ and the impact parameter $b$. The Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) is shown for reference.

Sample scatter orbit
-----

![](/images/ScatterPaper.gif)

A sample scatter geodesics parameterised by $(v_\infty,b)=(0.2,21M)$. The Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) is shown for reference.

Scatter orbit definitions
-----

![](/images/ImpactParamScattAngleDef.gif)

A graphical representation of the definitions of the impact parameter $b$ and the scatter angle $\delta\varphi$

Weak-field scatter orbit
-----

![](/images/PMScatter.gif)
A sample scatter geodesic parameterised by $(v_\infty,b)=(0.5,100M)$.

Strong-field bound orbit.
-----

![](/images/BoundOrbit.gif)

A sample bound orbit around a Kerr black hole with $(a,p,e,\theta_{\rm inc}) = (0.998, 6, 0.5, \pi/8)$. The trajectory was generated using the KerrGeodesics package of the [Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit](https://bhptoolkit.org/).


Weak-field bound orbit
-----

![](/images/PNPMOrbit.gif)

A small portion of the bound orbit of two equal mass compact objects at large separation.

<br>Graphical representations of the string solutions of the metric perturbation $h$ in radiation gauges. The red line represents the string-like singularity and background colours represent different radiation gauges. <em>Left</em>: Full-string solution. <em>Centre</em>: Half-string solutions. <em>Right</em>: No-string solution.
