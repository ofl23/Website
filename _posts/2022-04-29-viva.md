Today was a remarkable day. My PhD viva consisted of a 45 minute presentation on my thesis followed by the standard Q&A session. Profs Carlos Sopuerta and Oscar Campos-Dias were very diligent examiners and asked many thought provoking questions about everything from the history of self-force formulation right through to my future plans. To be truly honest it felt just like casually discussing research for a couple of hours rather than an examination. I actually enjoyed it! The best part of the day though was when I got to come back into the room and was told that I had passed with no corrections!  

I'd like to thank Carlos and Oscar for being my examiners and also a shoutout to the independent chair Prof Dankmar Bohning. I would also like to thank my supervisor Prof Leor Barack for all the guidance he has given me throughout my project and I am very much looking forward to continuing working with Leor and my secondary supervisor Dr Adam Pound when I start my Research Fellow position at Southampton in the coming months!
